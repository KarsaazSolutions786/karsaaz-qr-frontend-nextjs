      # - Download build artifact from CI workflow
      # - Configure cloud provider credentials (AWS/GCP/Azure)
      # - Deploy to target environment (Vercel, Docker registry, K8s, etc.)
      # - Run smoke tests against deployed environment
      # - Notify team on success/failure (Slack, Discord, etc.)
